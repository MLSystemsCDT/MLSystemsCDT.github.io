Machine Learning (ML) is everywhere. But ML performance depends on the systems that implements it. Systems research and ML research are symbiotic. The EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in ML Systems trains PhD students across the full machine learning-systems stack. Students collaboratively research the right methods and the right ways to deploy things to make ML work for real problems.
